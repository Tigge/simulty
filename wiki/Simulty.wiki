= Simulty Wiki =

Welcome to the Simulty Wiki. Here you can find information about the game, the development and everything else related to the game. The wiki is divided into three different sections.

== Documentation ==

This is the end user documentation. Everything in this section is about how to play Simulty. This section is almost empty as the game is nowhere near being finished.

  * Learn [HowToPlay how to play]

== Design Document ==

This section contains all information on what the game *should* be like. All ideas, plans and concepts can be found here. Some of the sections are:

  * [DesignDocumentSummary Summary]
  * [DesignDocumentConcepts Concepts]

== Developing ==

Information about how to develop Simulty, build it or what needs to be done right now can be found in this section. Some good entry points are:
