== Introduction ==

=== Game idea === 

Team up with one or more friends and cooperate or compete with each other to make your city the worlds greatest. You can also play by yourself. Build and manage your city placing resident zones, making sure there is enough power and that the people can get to their jobs by building roads.

You can race with your friend to win by making the biggest or most populated city in a set number of years or you can take it easy and just play togheter helping each other make one great city.

The game places you in position of mayor of a city or part of a city. Everyone can enjoy this game. Play in your own pace with a college at work or race with one of your class mates.

=== Target group ===

The resources described in the concept area should also be visible on the map.
