= Political ideas =
The idea is that Simulty eventually will get its own political simulator. This documents outlines the design of that system.

== Summary ==

A political simulator will influence game play in certain ways making it harder or easier to do stuff. One example could be that if the environmentalist get into power they '''pass a law / ordinance''' prohibit building coal and oil plants and make you pay fees for cheaper public transportation.

'''Events''' influence how much support the parties have. If few of the citizens have jobs the support for the Socialist party raises or if there is a warning for global warming the environmentalist get a bit more support. Also random scandals of different types affect the support of different parties. Also more in-game events like destroying a police station could please the anarchists.

'''Elections''' occur Voting happens every X year (perhaps every 5th year) and the one with most support probably wins the election. The winning party controls / influences the state / city (more or less) during the next five years.

== Technical ==

=== UML (draft) ===

[[Image:simulty_political_uml.png]]

=== Support (Popularity) ===
Totally 100% of the popularity are divided among the different parties. 
At all time the total support must equal 100%. In this simulation 100% = 1.0.

=== Issues ===

Party support for different issues range from 100% non supportive (-1.0) to 100% supportive (1.0).
Need to be equal to 0.0 in the end? (I don't see the need for this yet)

=== Events ===

Events can be targeted at one party or all paries.
