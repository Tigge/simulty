#summary Design Document: Electricty

=Electricity=

Every building needs a certain amount of electricty depending on their size and level. Special buildings have a set requirement.

To satisfy the electricity need the city needs to have sufficient power to supply the whole city.

== Algorithm ==

For early versions of the game when there is no power lines we will use a simple algorithm that powers the closest buildings first.

{{{
for(each player) {
  buildings = all players buildings
  for(each powerplants) {
     while(capacity >= 0) {
        closest building in buildings list = powered
        capacity = capacity - building need
        remove building from list
     }
  }
}
}}}

Where a buildings elecricity need is:

{{{
if(special building) {
  need = the special buildings elecricity need (declared in the xml file)
} else {
  need = width * height * level
}

}}}
