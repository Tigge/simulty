    <h2>About</h2>

         id="screenshot" width="300" alt="Early alpha version" />
       Team up with one or more friends and cooperate or compete with each other
       to make your city the worlds greatest. You can also play by yourself. 
       Build and manage your city placing resident zones, making sure there is 
       enough power and that the people can get to their jobs by building 
       roads.</p>

    <p>You can race with your friend to win by making the biggest or most 
       populated city in a set number of years or you can take it easy and just
       play together helping each other make one great city.</p>

    <p>The game places you in position of mayor of a city or part of a city. 
       Everyone can enjoy this game. Play in your own pace with a colleague at 
       work or race with one of your class mates.</p>

    <h2>Develop</h2>

    <p>If you want to help develop Simulty you can take a look at the project
       <a href="http://www.tigge.org/projects/index.php?title=Simulty">wiki</a>
       or our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/simulty/">sf.net</a> page
       where you can find more information. Another option is to send an e-mail
       to <a href="mailto:simulty@tigge.org">simulty@tigge.org</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Simulty is free software (GPL v2) and is designed to be a cross platform
       product that works on at least Windows, Linux and Mac and hopefully 
       everywhere else where the libraries we use can function.</p>
       
    <p>Currently Simulty uses Allegro and is known to compile and work (with the
       cmake system) on at Windows and Linux, but should also work on Mac.</p>
