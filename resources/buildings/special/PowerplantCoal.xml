  <name>Coal Powerplant</name>
  <description>The coal is pulverized and injected into the furnace where it 
      instantly is ignited. Water going through pipes in the furnace is heated
      up and the steam generated drives a turbine connected to a generator.
      
      The coal powerplant gives away both ash as a solid product but also lets
      out carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides gases. A coal 
      powerplant is one of the worst solutions in terms of enivornment but it 
      is rather cheap and produces a good amount of electricity.</description>
